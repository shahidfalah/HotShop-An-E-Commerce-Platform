Flash Sales: Products marked as flash sales display a countdown timer and discounted prices.

Shopping Cart: Add products to a persistent shopping cart.

Wishlist: Save products to a personal wishlist.

User Authentication: Secure login and signup using NextAuth.js (supporting Google OAuth and credentials).

User Account Management: View order history, manage reviews, and update profile settings.

Responsive Design: Optimized for a smooth experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Toasts: User-friendly notifications for actions (e.g., "Product added to cart!").

Admin Panel:

Dashboard Overview: Key statistics on products, categories, users, reviews, and orders.

Product Management: Add new products (with image uploads).

Category Management: Add new product categories.

User Management: (Placeholder for future implementation)

Review Management: (Placeholder for future implementation)

Order Management: (Placeholder for future implementation)

üöÄ Technologies Used
Frontend:

Next.js 14 (App Router): React framework for building performant web applications with Server Components and Client Components.

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

TypeScript: Strongly-typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced code quality and maintainability.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.

Lucide React: Beautiful, open-source icons.

react-hot-toast: Lightweight and customizable toast notifications.

colorthief: (Client-side) For extracting dominant colors from images for dynamic backgrounds.

Backend & Database:

NextAuth.js: Flexible authentication library for Next.js applications (Google OAuth, Credentials Provider).

Prisma ORM: Next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript, used for database interactions.

PostgreSQL (via Supabase): Relational database for storing application data.

Supabase Storage: For storing product images and other media assets.

Next.js API Routes: For building server-side API endpoints (/api/cart, /api/wishlist, etc.).

Deployment:

Vercel (Recommended): Ideal for deploying Next.js applications.

‚ö° Performance Optimizations
A strong focus has been placed on optimizing the application's performance, as evidenced by high Lighthouse scores (typically 95+ for Performance on both mobile and desktop). Key strategies implemented include:

Next.js Server Components: Leveraging Server Components to fetch data and render HTML on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving Time To First Byte (TTFB).

Code Splitting & Lazy Loading: Using React.lazy and React.Suspense to dynamically import and render client-side components (e.g., modals, countdown timers, UI elements) only when they are needed, significantly reducing Total Blocking Time (TBT).

next/image Optimization: Configured next.config.ts to enable automatic image optimization (resizing, format conversion to WebP/AVIF) for images hosted on Supabase and other external domains (lh3.googleusercontent.com), drastically improving Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).

Efficient Data Fetching: Optimized API routes and Prisma queries to minimize database calls (e.g., addressing N+1 query problems) and ensure data is fetched efficiently.

Asynchronous Script Loading: External scripts like ColorThief are loaded asynchronously to prevent render-blocking.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the HotShop project locally:

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)

npm or Yarn

Git

1. Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd hotshop

2. Install Dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

3. Set up Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

# Database (Supabase PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR_DB_PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres?schema=public"

# Supabase Storage (for images)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://[YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF].supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="[YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY]"

# NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="[A_VERY_LONG_RANDOM_STRING_FOR_PRODUCTION]" # Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` or similar
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000" # For local development

# Google OAuth (Optional, if you enable Google login)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="[YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID]"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="[YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET]"

# Application URL (for server-side fetches in API routes)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000" # For local development

Important Notes:

DATABASE_URL: Get this from your Supabase Project Settings -> Database -> Connection String. Ensure you use the prisma user or a user with full access.

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL & NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: Get these from your Supabase Project Settings -> API.

NEXTAUTH_SECRET: Crucial for production security. Generate a strong, random string.

NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL: This is used for server-side fetches within API routes. In production, this should be your deployed domain (e.g., https://your-hotshop-domain.vercel.app).

4. Set up Supabase Storage
In your Supabase project, go to Storage.

Create a new bucket named product-images.

Set its policies to allow public reads (if you want images to be publicly accessible without authentication). A common policy for public read is:

CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'product-images');

And for authenticated upload:

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'product-images' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

Adjust policies as per your security requirements.

5. Run Prisma Migrations
This will sync your Prisma schema with your Supabase PostgreSQL database.

npx prisma migrate dev --name init

6. Run the Development Server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application.
