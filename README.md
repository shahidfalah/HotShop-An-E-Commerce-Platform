# **HotShop: An E-Commerce Platform**

HotShop is a full-stack e-commerce application built with Next.js 15 (App Router), designed for flash sales and efficient product management. It provides a seamless shopping experience for users and a robust administration panel for store owners.

## **‚ú® Features**

**User-Facing:**

* **Product Listings:** Browse all products with category filtering.  
* **Product Details:** View detailed product information, including prices, descriptions, and images.  
* **Flash Sales:** Products marked as flash sales display a countdown timer and discounted prices.  
* **Shopping Cart:** Add products to a persistent shopping cart with quantity management. The "Add to Cart" button dynamically changes to "Remove from Cart" if the item is already in the cart.  
* **Wishlist:** Save products to a personal wishlist. On the wishlist page, "Add to Cart" buttons for wishlisted items also reflect their current cart status, allowing direct adding or removing.  
* **User Authentication:** Secure login and signup using NextAuth.js (supporting Google OAuth and credentials).  
* **User Account Management:** View order history, manage reviews, and update profile settings.  
* **Real-time UI Updates:** Cart and Wishlist counts in the header update instantly across the application when items are added, removed, or quantities are changed, without requiring a full page refresh.  
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for a smooth experience across mobile, and desktop devices.  
* **Toasts:** User-friendly notifications for actions (e.g., "Product added to cart\!").

**Admin Panel:**

* **Dashboard Overview:** Key statistics on products, categories, users, reviews, and orders.  
* **Product Management:** Add new products (with image uploads).  
* **Category Management:** Add new product categories.  
* **User Management:** (Placeholder for future implementation)  
* **Review Management:** (Placeholder for future implementation)  
* **Order Management:** (Placeholder for future implementation)

## **üöÄ Technologies Used**

**Frontend:**

* **Next.js 15 (App Router):** React framework for building performant web applications with Server Components and Client Components.  
* **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  
* **TypeScript:** Strongly-typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced code quality and maintainability.  
* **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling. **(Note: Uses \[--var-name\] syntax for custom CSS variables, e.g., bg-\[--color-primary\])**  
* **Lucide React:** Beautiful, open-source icons.  
* **react-hot-toast:** Lightweight and customizable toast notifications.  
* **colorthief:** (Client-side) For extracting dominant colors from images for dynamic backgrounds.

**Backend & Database:**

* **NextAuth.js:** Flexible authentication library for Next.js applications (Google OAuth, Credentials Provider).  
* **Prisma ORM:** Next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript, used for database interactions.  
* **PostgreSQL (via Supabase):** Relational database for storing application data.  
* **Supabase Storage:** For storing product images and other media assets.  
* **Next.js API Routes:** For building server-side API endpoints (/api/cart, /api/wishlist, etc.).

**Deployment:**

* **Vercel:** Ideal for deploying Next.js applications.

## **‚ö° Performance Optimizations**

A strong focus has been placed on optimizing the application's performance, as evidenced by high Lighthouse scores (typically 95+ for Performance on both mobile and desktop). Key strategies implemented include:

* **Next.js Server Components:** Leveraging Server Components to fetch data and render HTML on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving Time To First Byte (TTFB).  
* **Server-Side Data Enrichment:** Product, cart, and wishlist statuses are checked on the server and passed to client components, ensuring immediate and accurate UI rendering on page load.  
* **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:** Using React.lazy and React.Suspense to dynamically import and render client-side components (e.g., modals, countdown timers, UI elements) only when they are needed, significantly reducing Total Blocking Time (TBT).  
* **next/image Optimization:** Configured next.config.ts to enable automatic image optimization (resizing, format conversion to WebP/AVIF) for images hosted on Supabase and other external domains (lh3.googleusercontent.com), drastically improving Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).  
* **Efficient Data Fetching:** Optimized API routes and Prisma queries to minimize database calls (e.g., addressing N+1 query problems) and ensure data is fetched efficiently.  
* **Asynchronous Script Loading:** External scripts like ColorThief are loaded asynchronously to prevent render-blocking.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up and run the HotShop project locally:

### **Prerequisites**

* Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)  
* npm or Yarn  
* Git

### **1\. Clone the Repository**

git clone https://github.com/shahidfalah/HotShop-An-E-Commerce-Platform.git  
cd hotshop

### **2\. Install Dependencies**

npm install  
\# or  
yarn install

### **3\. Set up Environment Variables**

Create a .env.local file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.
```
Database (Supabase PostgreSQL)  
DATABASE\_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR_DB_PASSWORD]:[YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres?schema=public"  
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR_DB_PASSWORD]:[YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres" # IMPORTANT: Add this for Prisma

# Supabase Storage (for images)  
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://[YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF].supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="[NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY]"

# NextAuth.js  
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="[A_VERY_LONG_RANDOM_STRING_FOR_PRODUCTION]" # Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` or similar

# Google OAuth (Optional, if you enable Google login)  
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="[YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID]"  
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="[YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET]"

# Application URL (for server-side fetches in API routes and NextAuth.js callbacks)  
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000" # For local development
```
**Important Notes:**

* **DATABASE\_URL & DIRECT\_URL**: Get these from your Supabase Project Settings \-\> Database \-\> Connection String. Ensure you use the prisma user or a user with full access. DIRECT\_URL is crucial for Prisma's internal operations and should be the same as DATABASE\_URL but without the ?schema=public part.  
* **NEXT\_PUBLIC\_SUPABASE\_URL & SUPABASE\_SERVICE\_ROLE\_KEY**: Get these from your Supabase Project Settings \-\> API. The **ANON\_KEY** is safe to expose to the browser for public reads.  
* **SUPABASE\_SERVICE\_ROLE\_KEY**: **This key is highly privileged and must be kept secret.** It should never be exposed on the client-side. Use it only in server-side code (e.g., API routes, server components) for operations that require bypassing Row Level Security (RLS) or performing administrative tasks.  
* **NEXTAUTH\_SECRET**: **Crucial for production security.** Generate a strong, random string.  
* **NEXT\_PUBLIC\_APP\_URL**: This is used for server-side fetches within API routes and for NextAuth.js callbacks. In production, this should be your deployed domain (e.g., https://hotshop-ten.vercel.app). **Ensure this matches the Authorized Redirect URIs configured in your Google Cloud Console for OAuth.**

### **4\. Set up Supabase Storage**

1. In your Supabase project, go to **Storage**.  
2. Create new buckets named product-images and category-images.  
3. Set their policies to allow public reads (if you want images to be publicly accessible without authentication). A common policy for public read is:  
   ```
   CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access for product images" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'product-images');  
   CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access for category images" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'category-images');
   ```

   And for authenticated upload:  
   ```
   CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated product image uploads" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'product-images' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');  
   CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated category image uploads" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'category-images' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
   ```
   Adjust policies as per your security requirements.

### **5\. Run Prisma Migrations**

This will sync your Prisma schema with your Supabase PostgreSQL database.
```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init # Use 'init' or a descriptive name
```
### **6\. Run the Development Server**
```
npm run dev  
```
or
```  
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
